# Kanban
In this project I implemented a management methodology that allows for organizing and prioritizing projects and their tasks, using boards, lists, and cards. 
With the right Kanban board software, managers can focus on managing and prioritizing the teamâ€™s tasks, keep the team in the loop, and control a steady workflow. 
This tool supports agile development and helps visualizing and managing the workflow.

This code is written in C#, including a full backened and a partial frontend implementation.
